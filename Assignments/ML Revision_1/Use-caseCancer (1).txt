Assignment Use-case:

Cancer Detection Modelling (Label: diagnosis, Features: remaining columns except id column)

Deploy two best model based on the following criteria

Model1: Get the best model based on Confusion Matrix and Numerical Metrics

Model2: Get the best model based on Viz Metrics


Visualize the decision regions of the generated model based on two features that has highest significance in the dataset with respect to the label.
Hint:
	To find the two best features, you can use support method using SBM that you
	have learned in Feature Engineering class :)
